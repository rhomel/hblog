<h1>Hello Humans</h1>

<p>We now live in the age of generative AI. Unfortunately this means the world is
now getting filled with more and more &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; content. That&rsquo;s another way
of saying &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; human generated content is decreasing.</p>

<p>As a fellow human deeply invested in technology, this is a huge mixture of
emotions: excitement and uncomfortable existentialism.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s ignore the p-doom scenarios for now. I&rsquo;d like to keep this first post
somewhat positive after-all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the dawn of the age of abundance&rdquo; is often the most positive outlook
when it comes to predictions of the future. &ldquo;If we (humans) get this right, in
the future you can have anything you want.&rdquo; That sounds really great and
promising.</p>

<p>But what if what I want is human interaction?</p>

<p>The counter argument for anything generated by AI is essentially the duck test:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it
probably is a duck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually it isn&rsquo;t phrased like that. The conversion is often more nuanced,
something like:</p>

<pre><code>George: There's an awful lot of AI slop these days, just today I was reviewing
        several AI generated code commits.

Alice:  Ok, but did they work?

George: Yes, but there were so many code quality issues! And does anyone even
        understand what the code is doing?

Alice:  Hmm, does it matter?
</code></pre>

<p>Here George laments that the craft of writing code is now lost to the means.
And Alice argues bluntly that the craft was not necessarily important.</p>

<p>If you asked me which side I was on, not more than a few weeks ago, I would
have said I&rsquo;m with George.</p>

<p>These days, especially after being force and actually using the LLMs for
coding, I&rsquo;m more in the middle: it is undeniable that the LLM will achieve
knowledge and speeds faster than I can ever hope to achieve in my lifetime. So
if my goal is simply to produce output, and the code is an accident, then to
<em>not</em> take advantage of the LLM is a waste of my time.</p>

<p>However that still doesn&rsquo;t answer my question: what if what people want is
human interaction? If it looks like a human, walks like a human, and talks like
a human, is it really human?</p>

<p>Most of us would say no, and no matter how impressive AI gets, its species is
something not human.</p>

<p>And that is actually fine. Take pets for example. We don&rsquo;t necessarily look at
our pets and expect them to <em>be</em> human. Pet owners would however argue they are
in some ways equal to humans. But no one can deny that a pet does not have the
same DNA as a human.</p>

<p>So now my prediction: humans will and always desire the human touch for a
subset of their needs. It won&rsquo;t be 100% and it won&rsquo;t be 0% either. But
somewhere in the middle. Some will desire more and others less. But the average
will fall bluntly in the middle.</p>
